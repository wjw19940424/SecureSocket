step1: Execute the Initialization.sh to produce CA root certification(./openssl/demoCA/cacert.pem), the private key of server(./openssl/server.key) and server certification signed by CA(./openssl/server.crt). 

step2: Execute make

step3: Run the secuserver with server's certification and server's private key. 
(secuserver ./openssl/server.crt ./openssl/server.key)

step4: Run the secuclient with CA root certification. 
(secuclient ./openssl/demoCA/cacert.pem)
